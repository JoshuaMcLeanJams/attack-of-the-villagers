Constructed in ~36 hours for MiniJam 13


## Story

You've slain all the heroes and holed up in your castle, but there's something
you forgot: The villagers. They're many, they're angry, and they're armed.

Better hire some minions right quick so you don't get a pitchfork through your
neck.


## Game Objects

**Red circle = you.**

Move: WASD/arrow keys / left stick / d-pad
Attack: A button / spacebar

**Green triangles = villagers who want to kill you.**

Try not to touch them, except with your sword.

**Yellow ovals = coins which you should collect.**

Grab the villager's hard-earned savings to hire minions or build a castle.

**Cyan diamonds = minions.**

They'll kill villagers and collect coins for you, but take a cut from each coin.

**Gray square = castle.**

Stay in the castle long enough to strengthen your weapon. This will be much
easier if you have a ton of minions to protect said castle.


## The Shop

**Minion: X button or key**

Adds a minion to obey and protect you.

**Castle: Y button or key**

Builds a castle which you hole up in, sharpening your weapon. When the timer at
the bottom of the screen runs out, you get a permanent +1 to damage.

**Heal: B button or key**

Sacrifice minions and absorb their souls to get +X to health, where X is the
number of minions sacrificed. Each time you heal, the cost goes up by one.


## Game Concepts/Tips

Stay in the castle until the timer at the bottom of the screen runs out to
increase your damage.

When you die, you get a multiplier for coins picked up... but you also lose all
current coins and minions.

The multiplier is based heavily on Wave, then the number of living minions,
and finally coins. Get farther to get a higher multiplier!

Your current coins and multiplier are saved every second. If you want to reset
the entire game, press the R key on your keyboard or Back on the controller.

Health and damage upgrades are permanent, so be sure to power up!

If you quit and come back, the round starts over with the same coins,
multiplier, health upgrades, and damage upgrades.

Got yourself stuck or want to experience the game again? Press R or Back on the
gamepad to reset your progress to zero.
